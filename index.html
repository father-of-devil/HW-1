<h1>Additional game information</h1>
Each match in PUBG begins with every player parachuting out of a plane with cosmetic clothing and no gear. Once the players land somewhere on the massive 8 x 8 km map, they must scramble to pick up weapons and armor before their opponents do to avoid early elimination.

Not only is gear distributed throughout the map, but it also is looted from defeated opponents. As the match progresses, the play area is restricted by a shrinking "bubble." Any players caught outside the bubble take damage over time, resulting in their eventual death if they don't return to the inside.
<h1>PUBG mobile versions</h1>
There are two mobile versions of PUBG; PUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield and PUBG: Army Attack. PUBG Exhilarating Battlefield is a similar version of the original PUBG game and PUBG: Army Attack is more of an arcade-style version of the game. Both mobile versions of PUBG are free-to-play and released for Android and iOS on February 9, 2018.
